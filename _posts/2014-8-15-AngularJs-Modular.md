There is a great talk that Nicholas Zakas gave (former front-end engineer for Yahoo and contributor to YUI).  He talks about decoupling the front-end into a modular web application utilizing the event-driven architecture pattern.  Here is a great summary as to how AngularJs acts like a Scalable Application Architecture.

**We can take this approach and relate it to AngularJs:**
- Base Library - AngularJs's own jqLite implementation
- App Core - angular itself using Pub/Sub to communicate between components
- Sandbox - scope passed to the controller
- Module - AngularJs Directives

To give a quick synopsis of that talk, it is based around the event-driven pattern.  There is a JavaScript framework called scaleApp that utilizes this type of pattern.  They have a good architecture synopsis on Nicholas Zakasâ€™s approach that you can quickly digest:  http://scaleapp.org/readme.html#architecture-overview && http://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/developers/articles/scalable-javascript-application-architecture.

To wrap-up, if we can talk about AngularJs and how we engineer it within our own domain utilizing a event-driven component / module methodology, I feel it can enhance our judgment when making decisions about its implementation and complementary frameworks and tools.
