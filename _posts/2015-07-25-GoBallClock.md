title: My first look at Go Lang.
---


Had my first look at the Go Lang. Went ahead with a small exercise and wrote a ball clock out of the language.

Overall, I am impressed.  It seems similiar to Swift yet has its own glow.  I really liked the ability to return multiple values.

Take a look at my solution on [GitHub](https://github.com/bradyclifford/BallClock).
